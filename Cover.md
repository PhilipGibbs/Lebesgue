# Slanted Cover
It was shown (Baez, Bagdasaryan, Gibbs 2015) that a hegagon with two corners removed by the edges of the hexagon rotated through 30 degrees plus some slant angle is a universal cover. It is also conjectured (Gibbs 2014) that the universal cover of least area is contained within this form for some value of slant angle. The case of zero slant angle was explaored by Pal, Sprague and Hansen.
