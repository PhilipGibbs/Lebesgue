# Slanted Cover
It was shown (Baez, Bagdasaryan, Gibbs 2015) that a hexagon with two corners removed (_C_ and _E_ in figure 1) by the edges of the hexagon rotated through 30 degrees plus some slant angle _σ_ is a universal cover. It is also conjectured (Gibbs 2014) that the universal cover of least area is contained within this form for some value of slant angle. The case of zero slant angle σ was explored by Pal, Sprague and Hansen but the new results suggest that a small non-zero angle is in fact optimal.

Draw an arc of radius 1 centred on _F_<sub>3</sub> touching the line segement _C_<sub>3</sub>_C_<sub>2</sub> at the point _K_ and intersecting the line segment _C_<sub>2</sub>_D_<sub>3</sub> at the point _G_ (see figure 2.) Remove the area _GKC_<sub>2</sub> bounded by the arc _GK_ and straight lines _GC_<sub>2</sub> and _KC_<sub>2</sub>

Draw an arc of radius 1 centred on _C_<sub>3</sub> touching the line segment _F_<sub>3</sub>_E_<sub>2</sub> at _H_ Draw a second arc of radius 1 centred on _B_<sub>3</sub> touching the line segment _E_<sub>2</sub>_E_<sub>3</sub> at _I_ Let _J_ be the point of intersection of the two arcs (see figure 3.) The region _HJIE_<sub>2</sub> bounded by the two arcs and two straight edges can be removed.
