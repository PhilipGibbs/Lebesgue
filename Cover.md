The aim of this text is to define a universal cover which could be minimal.

### Slanted Cover
It was shown (Baez, Bagdasaryan, Gibbs 2015) that a hexagon with two corners removed (_C_ and _E_ in figure 1) by the edges of the hexagon rotated through 30 degrees plus some slant angle _σ_ is a universal cover. It is also conjectured (Gibbs 2014) that the universal cover of least area is contained within this form for some value of slant angle. The case of zero slant angle σ was explored by Pal, Sprague and Hansen but the new results suggest that a small non-zero angle is in fact optimal. 

The sections below discribe five small regions named _Ci_, _Ei_, _Eii_, _Ai_ and _Aii_ to remove from the slanted Pal cover in order to reduce it to what may be the optimal solution.

Diagrams are drawn with a slant angle of 7 degree unless otherwise stated. This is larger than the optimal slant angle around 1.5 degree.

### Removal of region _Ci_ near point _C_<sub>2</sub> 
Draw an arc of radius 1 centred on _F_<sub>3</sub> touching the line segement _C_<sub>3</sub>_C_<sub>2</sub> at the point _K_ and intersecting the line segment _C_<sub>2</sub>_D_<sub>3</sub> at the point _G_ (see figure 2.) Remove the area _GKC_<sub>2</sub> bounded by the arc _GK_ and straight lines _GC_<sub>2</sub> and _KC_<sub>2</sub>

### Removal of region _Ei_ near point _E_<sub>2</sub> 
Draw an arc of radius 1 centred on _C_<sub>3</sub> touching the line segment _F_<sub>3</sub>_E_<sub>2</sub> at _H_ Draw a second arc of radius 1 centred on _B_<sub>3</sub> touching the line segment _E_<sub>2</sub>_E_<sub>3</sub> at _I_ Let _J_ be the point of intersection of the two arcs (see figure 3.) The region _HJIE_<sub>2</sub> bounded by the two arcs and two straight edges can be removed.

### Removal of region _Eii_ near point _E_<sub>2</sub> 
More area can be removed from near _E_<sub>2</sub>. The following construction is applicable for slant angles less than 10 degrees. Let _R_ be the intersection of the line segment _F_<sub>2</sub>_F_<sub>3</sub> with the centre line _F_<sub>1</sub>_C_<sub>1</sub>. For slant angles less than 10 degrees the distance from _R_ to _C_<sub>3</sub> is less than 1. An arc of radius 1 centred on _R_ will therefore intersect the line segement _C_<sub>3</sub>_B_<sub>2</sub> at a point _S_. An arc centred on _S_ intersects the arc _JI_ at a point _T_.(see figure 4)

Consider the edge of the regular dodecahedron that would remove the triangle near _E_ is the slant angle were zero. This line would cut the arc _HJ_ at a point _U_  

The straight line _TU_ can now be used to remove an extra region _TUJ_. This is shown highly zoomed in figure 5 which has been drawn with a slant angle of 2.0 degree for better clarity.

### Removal of region _Ai_ near point _A_ 
Draw an arc of radius 1 centred on _G_ touching the edge _A_<sub>1</sub>_F_<sub>1</sub> at _P_. Draw and arc of radius 1 centred on _E_<sub>3</sub> touching _B_<sub>1</sub>_A_<sub>1</sub> at _O_. Let _X_ be the point where the two arcs meet. The region _OXPA_<sub>1</sub> bounded by the two arcs and two straight edges can be removed.

### Removal of region _Aii_ near point _A_
A line drawn from the point _F_<sub>3</sub> to _G_ has length one. Let _θ_ (theta) be the angle that this makes to the edge _ED_ of the hexagon. Consider more generally a line of length one between a point on the side _EF_ to a point _L_(_s_) on the side _DC_ which makes an angle _s_ to the side _ED_ with _L_(-_θ_) = _G_. Define also a point _N_(_t_) on the edge DE at a distance _t_ from the midpoint _M_ of that edge of the hexagon for -_τ_ ≤ t ≤ _τ_ such that _N_(_τ_) = _E_<sub>3</sub>. (see figure 7a)

##### Figure 7a
![Figure 7a](figures/fig7a.png)

Two circular arcs of radius one centred on _L_(_s_) and _N_(_t_) will meet at a point _X_(_s_,_t_) near the top corner _A_ of the hexagon. The set of points _X_(_s_,_t_) for -_θ_ ≤ s ≤ _θ_ and -_τ_ ≤ t ≤ _τ_ is bounded by four arcs.

##### Figure 7b
![Figure 7b](figures/fig7b.png)

We can draw a line from the point _X_(_θ_, _τ_) to the point _X_(0,0), making it the shortest line that stays within this region. For large enough slant angles this is a straight one as shown in figure 7b, but for smaller angles it consists of an arc and a straight line. For each point _X_(_s_,_t_) on this line there is an image point _X_(-_s_,-_t_). These points form a curve from _X_(0,0) to _P_ = _X_(-_θ_, -_τ_). The combination of these points form a line from _X_(-_θ_, -_τ_) to _X_(_θ_, _τ_) which we use to cut off the region _Aii_ from the cover.
