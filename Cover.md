# Slanted Cover
It was shown (Baez, Bagdasaryan, Gibbs 2015) that a hexagon with two corners removed (C and E in fig 1) by the edges of the hexagon rotated through 30 degrees plus some slant angle σ is a universal cover. It is also conjectured (Gibbs 2014) that the universal cover of least area is contained within this form for some value of slant angle. The case of zero slant angle σ was explored by Pal, Sprague and Hansen but the new results suggest that a small non-zero angle is in fact optimal.
