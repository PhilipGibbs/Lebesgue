# Lebesgue
Lebesgue's Universal Covering Problem

# Definitions
Lebesgue's universal covering problem seeks the convex planar shape of minimum area that can cover any shape of unit diameter.

The diameter of a shape is the least upper bound (supremum) on the distance between any two points in the shape.
For a shape C To cover a shape S means that C conatains a subset congruent to S. In other words we can rotate, translate and/or reflect S so that it fits inside C.
A universal cover for shapes of diameter one is a shape that covers all such shapes.
Henri Lebesgue posed this problem in a letter to Pal in 1914.

# Goals
The ambitious goal of this project is to solve this problem. More relaistic minor goals are:
  To find and prove an improved upper bound
  To find an improved lower bound conditional on some assumptions about the form of the answer.
  To find a bound that is likely to be the best bound

# Variants
Variants of the problem that are also of interest and which may be worked on here involve combinations of
  dropping the convexity condition
  dropping the ability to use reflections in covering
  dropping the ability to use rotations in covering (e.g. look for a pure translation cover)

# Intermediate Statements
Numerical Calculations suggest that any of the following statements may be true

- The minimal area cover for any subset of shapes of diameter one is contained inside a hexagonal parallelogon.
- The minimal area (translation) cover for any subset of shapes of diameter one is contained by a strip of diamter one
- The minimal area (translation) cover for any subset of shapes of diameter one is contained in a rhombus whose parallel sides are a unit distance apart
- The minimal cover for all shapes of diameter one is contained in a regular hexagon with an inscribed circle of unit diameter.
- The minimal cover translation cover is contained in a square of side one 
- The minimal cover for all shapes of diameter one is contained in a regular hexagon with an inscribed circle of unit diameter with two corners cut off by the edges of a congruent hexagon with the same centre.

Any of these statements may be treated as a conjecture for which a proof can be attempted or an assumption on which a conditional proof can be based. If both these steps are achieved for a single statement then it is an intermediate step in a complete proof.
