Lebesgue's Universal Covering Problem

Lebesgue's universal covering problem seeks the convex planar shape of minimum area that can cover any shape of unit diameter.

The diameter of a shape is the least upper bound (supremum) on the distance between any two points in the shape.
For a shape C To cover a shape S means that C conatains a subset congruent to S. In other words we can rotate, translate and/or reflect S so that it fits inside C.
A universal cover for shapes of diameter one is a shape that covers all such shapes.
Henri Lebesgue posed this problem in a letter to Pal in 1914.

The ambitious goal of this project is to solve this problem. More relaistic minor goals are:
  To find and prove an improved upper bound
  To find an improved lower bound conditional on some assumptions about the form of the answer.
  To find a bound that is likely to be the best bound

Variants of the problem that are also of interest and which may be worked on here involve combinations of
  dropping the convexity condition
  dropping the ability to use reflections in covering
  dropping the ability to use rotations in covering (e.g. look for a pure translation cover)
