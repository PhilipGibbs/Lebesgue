In [cover](cover.md) a shape was defined as a function of the slant angle _σ_. 
In this document that shape is proven to be a universal cover for all shapes of diameter one.
This sets an upper limit on the area for the least universal cover.

The first step is to show that every shape of diameter one can be contained within a curve of constant width one.
This was proven in (Pál 1920) see also (Vrecica 1981)

The second step is to show that the regular hexagon with two corners removed at a slant angle is a universal cover (see cover: figure 1)
This was proven in (Baez, Bagdasaryan, Gibbs 2015)
