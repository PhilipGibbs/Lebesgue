### Henri Lebesgue (1914), *Letter to Julius Pal*, described in (Pal 1920)
In this letter Henri Pal proposed his universal covering problem

### J. Pál, (1920). "Über ein elementares Variationsproblem". Danske Mat.-Fys. Meddelelser III. 2.
Pal reported the problem posed to him by Lebesgue and set the first upper bound with a cover of area 0.84529946

### R. Sprague, (1936). "Über ein elementares Variationsproblem". Matematiska Tidsskrift Ser. B: 96–99
Sprague showed that a region of Pal's cover can be removed reducing the area to 0.844137708436

### G.F.D. Duff (1980), "A smaller universal cover for sets of unit diameter", C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. 2 (1980), 37–42
A smaller universal cover was found for the case where the cover is not required to be convex

### S. Vrecica (1981), "A note on curves of constant width", Publications de L’Institut Math´ematique 29 (1981), 289–291
A proof that every shape of diameter one can be contained in a curve of constant width one. This was also established by Pal but paper/translation is not available.

For the case of the convex cover it is shown that a minimal cover exists. See also Weiss-Kelly (1979)

A triangle circle and Pentagon are combined in an optimal configuration to set a lower bound of 0.832 

### Philip Gibbs, (2014) "A New Slant on Lebesgue's Universal Covering Problem", arXiv:1401.8217
The results of computational searches led to the idea that Pal's cuts can be taken at a different slant angle leading to an improved upper bound.

### J.C. Baez, K. Bagdasaryan, P. Gibbs, (2015) "The Lebesgue Universal Covering Problem", Journal of Computational Geometry 6(1), 288–299
The slant method is used to set a new upper bound of 0.8441153. The goal here was to establish a new bound with a simple and clear argument rather than to set the best bound posible with the known techniques
