### H.W.E. Jung, "Über die kleinste Kugel die eine räumliche Figur einschliesst" Reine Agnew Math 123 (1901) 241-257
A circle of radius 1/sqrt(3) is a universal cover of area 1.047

### Henri Lebesgue (1914), *Letter to Julius Pal*, described in (Pal 1920)
In this letter Henri Pal proposed his universal covering problem

### Julius (Gyula) Pál, (1920). "Über ein elementares Variationsproblem". Danske Mat.-Fys. Meddelelser III. 2.
Pal reported the problem posed to him by Lebesgue and set the first upper bound with a cover of area 0.84529946
He also set a lower bound using the combination of a circle and triangle at 0.8257

### Roland P. Sprague, (1936). "Über ein elementares Variationsproblem". Matematiska Tidsskrift Ser. B: 96–99
Sprague showed that a region of Pal's cover can be removed reducing the area to 0.844137708436 (He did not compute the area)

### Herbert Meschkowski, Ungelöste und unlösbare Probleme der Geometrie, Braunschweig 1960, (translated as Unsolved and unsolvable problems in geometry, Oliver and Boyd 1966, translated by Jane A.C. Burlak)
Computed the area of Sprague's cover and claimed that Sprague believed it to be minimal in the sense that no further area could be removed. This book and its translation are given credit for popularising the problem.

### G.F.D. Duff (1980), "A smaller universal cover for sets of unit diameter", C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. 2 (1980), 37–42
A smaller universal cover was found for the case where the cover is not required to be convex

A proof that every shape of diameter one can be contained in a curve of constant width one. This was also established by Pal but paper/translation is not available.

### Philip E. Gibbs, (2014) "A New Slant on Lebesgue's Universal Covering Problem", arXiv:1401.8217
The results of computational searches led to the idea that Pal's cuts can be taken at a different slant angle leading to an improved upper bound.

### John C. Baez, Karine Bagdasaryan, Philip E. Gibbs, (2015) "The Lebesgue Universal Covering Problem", Journal of Computational Geometry 6(1), 288–299
The slant method is used to set a new upper bound of 0.8441153. The goal here was to establish a new bound with a simple and clear argument rather than to set the best bound posible with the known techniques
