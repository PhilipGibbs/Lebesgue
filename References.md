### Henri Lebesgue (1914), *Letter to Julius Pal*, described in (Pal 1920)
In this letter Henri Pal proposed his universal covering problem

### H. C. Hansen (1992), "Small Universal covers for sets of unit diameter", Geometriae Dedicata 42 (1992) 205-213
The upper bound was reduced by 4.10^-11

### Peter Brass, Mehrbod Sharifi, (2005) "A Lower Bound for Lebesgues' Universal Covering Problem", Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 15, 537
A triangle circle and Pentagon are combined in an optimal configuration to set a lower bound of 0.832 

### Philip Gibbs, (2014) "A New Slant on Lebesgue's Universal Covering Problem", arXiv:1401.8217
The results of computational searches led to the idea that Pal's cuts can be taken at a different slant angle leading to an improved upper bound.

### J.C. Baez, K. Bagdasaryan, P. Gibbs, (2015) "The Lebesgue Universal Covering Problem", Journal of Computational Geometry 6(1), 288â€“299
The slant method is used to set a new upper bound of 0.8441153. The goal here was to establish a new bound with a simple and clear argument rather than to set the best bound posible with the known techniques
