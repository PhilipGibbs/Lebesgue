### Peter Brass, Mehrbod Sharifi, (2005) "A Lower Bound for Lebesgues' Universal Covering Problem", Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 15, 537
A triangle circle and Pentagon are combined in an optimal configuration to set a lower bound of 0.832 

### Philip Gibbs, (2014) "A New Slant on Lebesgue's Universal Covering Problem", arXiv:1401.8217
The results of computational searches led to the idea that Pal's cuts can be taken at a different slant angle leading to an improved upper bound.
